## Galaxy's Edge Beacon Emulator for Flipper Zero

This application allows the emulation of beacons emitted by the droids from Droid Depot, including any of their personality chips and those located in the Galaxy's Edge theme park.

The application was designed for Flipper Zero devices capable of running JavaScript code and supporting the loading of the blebeacon module. The application was successfully tested with the Momentum firmware.

The SWGE folder must be uploaded to the apps\Scripts directory.
To execute it, navigate from the Flipper Zero's screen to Apps and then to the Scripts option.
